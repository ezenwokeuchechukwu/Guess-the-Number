# Overview

This project is a simple number guessing game built using Java. It demonstrates key programming concepts including variables, expressions, conditionals, loops, functions, classes, file input/output, and use of a Java Collection (`ArrayList`). 

The user tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. Each guess is stored in memory, and the full guess history is saved to a text file after the game ends. This project helped reinforce core Java skills and provided hands-on experience with the language's structure and syntax.
